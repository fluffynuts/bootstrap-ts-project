# bootstrap-ts-project

Bootstraps a TypeScript npm module project

## Why?

Because I'm making enough of them that:
1. I see a pattern
2. I'm tired of manually repeating that pattern


## Status
- this project is _not yet_ ready for general consumption, but I'd like to reserve a name (:
- the core work is done
- cli is coming
